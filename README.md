--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This systematic review synthesises the spatial methods used to model mosquito-borne diseases, their spatial connectivity assumptions, and the data used to inform spatial model components.

A description of each file and folder is provided below:

  **Figures.R:** `R` script used to create figures from the manuscript and supplementary materials.

  **Supp_Table.R:** `R` script to create Supplementary table 1.

  **centroid_function.R:** `R` script to obtain the coordinates of a polygon centroid, sourced in **Figures.R**.
  
  **data:** a folder containing data extracted from papers included in the systematic review and example connectivity data used to create Figure 3. 
  
  **output:** a folder to save the output generated by the `R` scripts.

The analysis was performed using R version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12).
